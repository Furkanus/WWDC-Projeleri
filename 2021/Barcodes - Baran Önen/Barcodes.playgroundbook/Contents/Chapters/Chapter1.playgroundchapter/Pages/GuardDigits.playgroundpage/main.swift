 # Guard Digits
 
 There are also 3 digits that help us locate where the barcode ends, where it starts and where its middle point is.
 
 While the middle digit has 5 bars in it, the start and end digits have 3. Here are their patterns:
 
 - Start: 101
 - Middle: 01010
 - End: 101
 
 Now, run the code and see how these digits look.
