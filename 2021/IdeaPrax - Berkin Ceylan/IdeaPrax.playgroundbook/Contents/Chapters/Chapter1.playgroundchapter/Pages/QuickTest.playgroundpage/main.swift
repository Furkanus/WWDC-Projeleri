 # Quick Test
 
 Yes! Now a fun test awaits you. There are 5 levels in this test. You will have 7 seconds for each level and before each level you will be shown some numbers in some colored boxes.üåà All you have to do is to touch these boxes in the correct order within 7 seconds.
 
 As a result, you will find a percentage. If you score above 7Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ percent, this is a good sign. However, if you score below 4Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ percent, it is recommended that you see a doctor.
 
 Enjoy!
