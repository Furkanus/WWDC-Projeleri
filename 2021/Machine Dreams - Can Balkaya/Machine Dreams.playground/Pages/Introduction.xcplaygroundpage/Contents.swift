 # Introduction

 Machine Dreams is a playground exhibition that explores how a machine can see dreams by transforming the images created by the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm in it using photographs of World and Mars into 3D moving objects.

 The exhibition aims to combine two of the most breathtaking topics of the 21st century, such as space and AI. During the creation process of the exhibition, I worked to create this exhibition a source of inspiration as well as being instructive.

 I annotated briefly about how I made this exhibition on the next page, because I'm hoping that other people will do much better than this playground.
 
 I hope you will enjoy this playground exhibition. ðŸŸ¥
