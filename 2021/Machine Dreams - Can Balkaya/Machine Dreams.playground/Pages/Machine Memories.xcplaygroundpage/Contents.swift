 You can also use AI data sculptures to create a three-dimensional view of any photo you want, like a projector. In this way, you can create your own AI data sculpture right away.
 
 Outside the art, it is possible to get funny and interesting images with this sculpture model such as 3D Dogecoin flag. ðŸ˜„
